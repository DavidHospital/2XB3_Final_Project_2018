The tornado touched down in Kandiyohi County and mostly hit trees and crops, but it did cause significant damage to a couple of large metal buildings.||There were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines in a swath from the South Dakota border, eastward into the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities. Although there were multiple reports of large hail, and some were measured up to golf ball size, the combination of strong winds and hail, took a toll on property, especially in the Twin Cities metro area. The county of Anoka reported some areas receiving up to two feet of hail which caused several cities to use snow plows. The county of Anoka also reported $650,000 in damage to public property and infrastructure.||Wind speeds were measured in several areas up to 70 knots indicating the severity of the storms as torrential rain and hail accompanied the wind. During the height of the storm, roughly 150,000 Xcel Energy customers were without power for several hours. ||One of the most dramatic incidents of damage occurred to the Monticello High School baseball dugout. A weather spotter said the cinder block structure was destroyed by the force of the storm. In that same city, a large tree toppled and landed on a home.||Two people were trapped when a damaged tree fell on them in St. Paul.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Radar estimated around two to over three inches of rain fell over portions of Sandusky and Seneca Counties on the afternoon of November 18. 911 centers reported widespread flooding in the counties with dozens of road closures in each county. Over 48 hours after the initial overland flooding mentioned here, the Portage and Sandusky Rivers flooded. The Portage River reached moderate flood stage and the Sandusky River reached minor flood stage. This lead to continued road closures for known spots along the rivers. No properties were inundated. ||In Seneca County as of 7:30 p.m., there were reports of at least 19 roads that were flooded. These roads included US 224 east of SR 67; CR 50 near the 2000 block; SR 4 near SR 162; CR 48 near SR 18 at the viaduct; the 4000, 5000 and 7000 blocks of South SR 53; SR 231 North of CR 6; CR 37 between CR 38 and CR 15; CR 58 between SR 19 and SR 4; and the westbound lane of US 224 in the 11000 block east of Attica.

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Two round of rain moved into Hancock County on the 18th. The morning rain of over an inch was followed by a heavier rain in the early afternoon with almost two inches. The heavier rain which fell on saturated ground caused widespread minor flooding and road closures in the area. Rainfall reports show two and a half inches to almost three inches. The resultant runoff caused the Eagle and Lye Creeks, and the Blanchard River to reach moderate flood stages. The elevated streambeds caused the local flood waters to linger into Sunday. ||The Hancock County Sheriff���s Office  issued this list of flooded roadways: |SR 103 - CR 9  - Van Buren Twp.|SR 235 - TR 29 - Orange Twp.|CR 139 - North of  SR 12 - Liberty Twp. |SR 613 - CR 140 and TR 142 - Allen Twp.|SR 235 - South of US 224 - Blanchard Twp. |CR 18 CLOSED - North of TR 213 - Allen Twp.|SR 613 - Stretch from I-75 to Fostoria - Allen, Cass, Washington Twp.|US 224 - CR 140 - Liberty Twp.|TR 215 CLOSED - CR 18 to TR 236 - Cass Twp.|CR 330- South of SR 568 - Biglick Twp.|CR 304 - West of CR 698 - Van Buren Twp.|SR 103 - Between TR 59 and TR 60 - Orange Twp.  |13000-14100 Block of CR 9 - Eagle Twp.|CR 9 - CR 24 - Eagle Twp.|CR 9 - CR 31 - Eagle Twp.|CR 304 - Between TR 61 and TR 698 - Van Buren Twp. |9000 Block of SR 235 - Blanchard Twp. |CR 139 - TR 95 to CR 97 - Portage Twp. |SR 613 - East of CR 139 - Portage Twp. |SR 186 - South of McComb - Pleasant Twp.|CR 172 - Near TR 240 - Jackson Twp.|CR 330 CLOSED - South of SR 12 - Washington Twp. |US 68 - TR 69 - Madison Twp.|TR 214 CLOSED - Between CR 248 and SR 12 - Cass, Washington Twp.|CR 7 - Between SR 568 and CR 248 - Biglick Twp.|CR 7 - Between CR 248 and TR 251 - Biglick Twp.|TR 70 CLOSED - Between CR 24 and TR 25 - Eagle Twp.|TR 25 CLOSED - Between TR 72 and CR 9 - Eagle Twp.|TR 72 CLOSED - Between CR 26 and TR 25 - Eagle Twp.|CR 203 CLOSED - Between CR 139 and CR 140 - Portage|CR 5 - 24,000 Block - Pleasant Twp.|CR 216 CLOSED - Between CR 23 and TR 260 - Washington Twp.|TR 234 - North of SR 37 - Marion Twp.|TR 208 CLOSED - Between TR 234 and TR 240 - Marion Twp.|SR 37 - Near TR 234 - Marion Twp.|In Findlay, water rose on I-75 around 725 pm.","CSV"

A warm front lifted into the area during the morning hours with an initial round of rain showers.  Warm and moisture rich air moved into the region behind the warm front with temperatures warmed into the 50s to even 60s with dew points in the 50s.  The area received between 1 1/2 to 2 inches of rain south of OH-30 in Marion, Morrow, Knox, and Richland Counties during the early morning hours through midday. This was soon followed by another round of rain associated with a strong cold frontal passage in the afternoon and evening. Some moderate to heavy rain was imbedded within a large swath of rain, especially south of State Route OH-30 where the heavier rain lingered longer. Rainfall totals for the event averaged 2 to 3 inches, with reports upwards of 3.75 inches.  River levels at the onset of the rain were low which allowed for several additional hours response time for the onset of riverine flooding.  The overland flooding concerns were greatly improved by Monday morning of the 20th, while some of the larger stem rivers remained in flood through mid week.  The most notable river flooding occurred on the Blanchard River at Findlay and the Portage River at Woodville where both locations were inches from major flood stage. A flood watch was issued at 949 am Saturday morning lasting through the evening. Numerous areal and river flood warnings were also issued.","Two rounds of rain moved over Stark County on the 18th. The first round during the morning produced around an inch to an inch and a half of rainfall. The second round in the afternoon and evening brought an additional inch to inch and a half. Rainfall reports in the county showed around two inches in the north and west, and over three inches in Canton east and south. The resultant flooding was minor in Canton with flooding on the Zimber Ditch where there were reports of some basement flooding on Furbee and Lucille Avenues, with water approaching businesses on Whipple Avenue Northwest. East of Canton in Louisville the East Branch of the Nimishillen Creek came out of banks flooding State Rt. 153 and Constitution Ave. The most notable flooding was in the southeast part of the county where at 10 pm through 3 am water from the Sandy Creek inundated basements and surrounded homes in Waynesburg on Oakhurst, Grovedale, Broadford Streets, and flooding State Rt 183. Rainfall total estimates in this area were close to four inches.  Water backed up into a mobile home park on Cleveland Southwest Avenue in Canton Township from the Nimishillen Creek. North Industry High School recreational grounds inundated with several feet of water.","CSV"
